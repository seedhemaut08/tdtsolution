# TDTS - React Website Scaffold

This is a Vite + React scaffold for the TDTS website (TODAY'S DATA TOMMORROW'S SOLUTION).

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes
- The contact form in `/src/pages/Contact.jsx` is a frontend form that `POST`s JSON to `/api/contact`. Provide a backend endpoint or integrate with your favorite server.
- The project uses plain CSS (src/styles.css). You can replace it with Tailwind or your preferred framework.
